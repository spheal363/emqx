## System Monitoring of the host machine

sysmon.os {
    ## Time interval for the periodic CPU check
    cpu_check_interval = 60s

    ## CPU monitoring now uses dynamic threshold based on core count (cores * 0.8)
    ## The old cpu_high_watermark and cpu_low_watermark settings are no longer used
    ## CPU usage is monitored using cpu_sup:avg1() which returns load average
    ## Load average > (cores * 0.8) triggers high CPU usage alarm

    ## Time interval for the periodic memory check
    ## Possible values:
    ##   disabled: Never check
    ##   Duration: Check every Duration 
    mem_check_interval = 60s

    ## For how much system memory can be allocated before the corresponding alarm is raised
    sysmem_high_watermark = 70%

    ## For how much system memory can be allocated by one Erlang process before the corresponding alarm is raised
    procmem_high_watermark = 5%
